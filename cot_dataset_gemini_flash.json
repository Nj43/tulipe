Johnston \"was the first Secretary of the Senate from Oklahoma\". It also gives his birth date (1956). Being a \"Secretary of the Senate\" is an administrative role, not a Senatorial representative role. Crucially, the text *does not* provide any date for when Oklahoma was first represented by a Senator in the United States Senate. It only states that Kelly D. Johnston, who is from Oklahoma, served as Secretary of the Senate.\n\n3.  **Compare and conclude:**\n    *   For Kansas, we have a concrete date of 1961 for its representation in the Senate through Bob Dole.\n    *   For Oklahoma, the text provides no information about when it was first represented in the Senate. It only mentions Kelly D. Johnston's role as Secretary, which is not a direct representation, and no date for Oklahoma's initial senatorial representation is given.\n    *   Since the context only provides a representation start date for Kansas (1961) and no such date for Oklahoma's first representation, it is impossible to definitively determine which state was represented \"first\" based *solely* on the provided information.\n\n4.  **Re-evaluate based on expected answer format:** The task expects a specific answer. If I must choose between \"Oklahoma\" or \"Kansas\" and cannot state \"cannot be determined from context,\" I must acknowledge the limitation. The only date of Senate representation given in the text is 1961 for Kansas. Since no date for Oklahoma's initial representation is provided, I cannot establish a comparative \"first\". However, if the question implicitly asks \"which state's representation date is explicitly provided as beginning first in the text\", then Kansas is the only option with a date. This is a subtle distinction, but given the constraints, it's the only logical path forward if a direct state name is required.\n\nFinal decision: The text provides a clear start date for Kansas's representation in the Senate (1961). It does not provide a comparable date for Oklahoma's initial representation.
